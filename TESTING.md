# Testing
Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

I have used various tools to Test Funcionality, Validity and responsiveness. I have been sure to check all layouts, colours, text, forms, links, buttons are functioning on all devices and screen sizes that I have tested.

## Code Validation

### HTML
All pages files have been tested with [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check validation.

### JavaScript

All Javascript files have been tested with [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to check validation. I used version 11 which does not throw errors due to use of ES6 syntax, Aswell as informing JSHint that I was intenionally using jQuery.

- sorting-script.js - PASS

The Javascript in the checkout.html could not be validated due to its use of Python code but a temporary structure without the use of Python was used for a successful code validation.

## Bugs
### Open Issues
none currently listed

### Solved bugs
#### Stripe Webhook
When first testing the Stripe webhook I found that if an order had too many items in it the order process would fail due to the stripe webhook having a character limit of 500, I had set the webhook up to contain all of the order data including the items but this is what was causing the error.

To solve the issue I implemented that as soon as the user submits their card details the order is created with a payment pending status, then that allowed for the webhook to only need to hold the order number. When the webook returns a payment intent succeeded with the order number only then is the order payment status updated to completed and the order is sent to printful for fulfillment.

This feature includes a bonus in that the site admin can see orders that have not completed payment and follow them up with an email.


#### Font package
I had an issue When the user hovered over a button, all the text changed to black except for the letter "N". I diagnosed this to be a font package issue as when I load the buttons with a different font the problem did not exist. The other option I found was to remove the text transform to uppercase class. 
I discussed with client which resolution they preffered and it was chosen to remove the uppercase transform.

#### Logo
I recieved an image to use as a logo but this was not of sufficient quality and did not look good on the preview site, I requested another image but this was poorly sized and pixelated.
I managed to get a much clearer image using image manipulation and AI software.

### Still to test upon deployment

- nav bar dropdown on screen sizes below 332px is a pain in the ass as it the dropdown does not ocnnedct to the nav bar making it look not great

- homepage styling on screens below 450px the buttons go out of the image this may be to do with my cody and home-content heigh calculations??

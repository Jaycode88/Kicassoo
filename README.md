Welcome to Kicassoo, the online showcase for an abstract artist. This website is dedicated to presenting the artist's profile and captivating collections. With a focus on artistic expression and creativity, Kicassoo offers visitors a glimpse into the vibrant world of contemporary art.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the website is to establish a foundational online presence for the artist, offering a curated showcase of select collections. As a starting point, Kicassoo serves as a platform to introduce the artist's work to a wider audience and provide a glimpse into their creative vision.

With a focus on simplicity and elegance, the website aims to present a few key collections in a visually compelling manner. By showcasing these curated collections, we aim to capture the essence of the artist's style and inspire engagement and interest from visitors.

## UX
### Colour Scheme
we've opted for a simple black and white color scheme. This deliberate choice is intended to create a minimalist backdrop that allows the artwork to take center stage. By keeping the overall design subdued, we aim to highlight the vibrant colors and intricate details of the artwork featured on the site.

The monochromatic palette not only emphasizes the visual impact of the images but also lends a sense of sophistication and timelessness to the website's aesthetic. Additionally, the use of black and white provides a versatile canvas that allows the artwork to shine while ensuring readability and clarity of text and navigation elements.

By embracing simplicity in our color selection, we aim to create a cohesive and elegant visual experience that puts the focus squarely on the artistry and creativity of the showcased collections.


### Typography
#### Logo and Headings

![Font](documentation/montaga.webp)

For the logo and headings, we've chosen the "Montaga" font. This font exudes elegance and sophistication, making it the perfect choice to represent the artist's brand and to headline the various sections of the website. Its graceful curves and bold strokes command attention, while its timeless aesthetic adds a touch of refinement to the overall design.

#### Body Text

![Font](documentation/opensans.webp)

The body text is set in "Open Sans." This font was selected for its clean and modern appearance, which enhances readability across different devices and screen sizes. With its neutral yet friendly demeanor, Open Sans ensures that the content remains accessible and easy to digest, allowing visitors to focus on the artist's narrative and portfolio without distraction.

#### Accents

![Font](documentation/montez.webp)

To add a hint of personality and flair to certain elements, we've incorporated "Montez" as our accent font. Montez's handwritten style brings a touch of whimsy and creativity to the website, serving as a playful counterpoint to the more structured fonts used elsewhere. This font is strategically employed for decorative purposes, such as embellishments or highlights, infusing the design with charm and character.

## Bugs
### Open Issues
#### Logo *
All images provided for logo are not of good enough qaulity to pop on the site as they should. Alternative images needed.
This applies to Meta Icon also!
Result: I have enhanced one of the supplied Image which looks better atleast until an alternative is provided

### Solved bugs
#### Font package
When the user hovers over a button all text changes to clack except for the letter "N". I have diagnosed this to be a font package issue as when I load the buttons with a different font the problem does not exist. This issue can also be resolved keeping the "Montaga" Font but removing the transform to uppercase so the letters displayed are lowercase.
resolution remover uppercase transform.

# Kicassoo
A website built for An Abstract Artist, The websites main purpose is to showcase The Artist's Profile and collections. Each Item in a collection is to show dimensions of the art piece but not any pricing or buying options instead there should be "Contact Me" calls to action for users to enquire regarding a collection or piece.

## Bugs
### Open Issues
#### Font package
When the user hovers over a button all text changes to clack except for the letter "N". I have diagnosed this to be a font package issue as when I load the buttons with a different font the problem does not exist. This issue can also be resolved keeping the "Montaga" Font but removing the transform to uppercase so the letters displayed are lowercase.

Final resolution/ Decision  to discuss with client.
